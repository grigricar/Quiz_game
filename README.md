<h2>Description</h2>
The is a Python coding project done in university as a final course assignment for the year one module. The task was to build a quiz game for the user, where a number of comparisons are given to the user and they have to decide "which is bigger." The required dictionary structure of comparisons was provided. As the focus of the course was on "Problem Solving with Python" much attention was given to thinking about and planning the structure of the alogrithm through decomposition before attempting to execute it in code. The decomposition is included in this repository.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>GitHub </b>
- <b>Markdown </b>

<h2> Skills </h2>

- <b>Algorithmic Decomposition</b> 
- <b>Basic dictionary structures</b>
- <b>Functions</b>
- <b>Basic dictionary structures</b>
- <b>Case splits</b>
- <b>'while' loops</b>

<h2> Reflection and Questions</h2>

The project did not draw from any external Python libraries, as such it forced us to stick to fundamentals and this was engaging. The decompostion process was unquestionably valuable. Forming the habit of breaking the problems down into subproblems, onto which recurring patterns cna be mapped, is critical in tackling more complex tasks. It is also time-saving, and is one of the most valued lessons I have taken away from the course.

</br>
<br>What this project lacked was any more advanced look at the data. Some questions and points to chew on include:</br>

</br>

-  <b>Could I play around more with ggplot2 in R to produce more clear and eye-catching graphs? </b>
-  <b>I would like to find more correlations between variables. I could have looked at temperature and weather influence on bike use, and investigated correlations with scatterplots, potentially building a basic regression model.  </b>
-  <b>The two datasets were merged. I could have done more to explore the differences between the two datasets to mark out what changes had occurred in the bike use over the period of a year.  </b>
- <b>Could some additional research give more insight into the difference between local and tourist use? </b>
- <b>Could I change the x-axis on the one graph to reflect the days rather then the numbers. Would this be part of the lab() function?
